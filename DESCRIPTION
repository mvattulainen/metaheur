Description: Automation of preprocessing often requires computationally costly
    preprocessing combinations. This package helps to find near-best combinations
    faster. Sub heuristics supported are random and grid restarts, taboo list,
    Simuated Anneling style decreasing propability for accepting inferior solutions
    and location of previously best solution to be compared to. Metaheur works with
    package preprocomb and takes its GridClass object as input.
