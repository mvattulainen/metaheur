Description: Automation of preprocessing often requires computationally costly
    preprocessing combinations. This package helps to find near-best combinations
    faster. Sub heuristics supported are random and grid restarts, taboo list,
    decreasing propability for accepting inferior solutions and location of
    previously best solution candidate is compared to. Metaheur works with
    package preprocomb and takes its GridClass object as input.
