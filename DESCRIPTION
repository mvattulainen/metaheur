Title: Metaheuristic Optimization Framework for Preprocessing Combinations
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2016-6-30
Author: Markus Vattulainen
Maintainer: Markus Vattulainen <markus.vattulainen@gmail.com>
Description: Automation of preprocessing often requires computationally costly
    preprocessing combinations. This package helps to find near-best combinations
    faster. Metaheuristics supported are taboo search, simulated annealing, reheating
    and late acceptance. Start conditions include randon and grid starts. End conditions
    include all iteration rounds completed, objective threshold reached and convergence.
    Metaheuristics, start and end conditions can be hybridized and hyperparameters optimized.
    Parallel computations are supported. The package is intended to be used with package
    'preprocomb' and takes its 'GridClass' object as input.
